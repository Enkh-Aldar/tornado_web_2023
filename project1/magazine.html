            Loremn 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him
            get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels, the
            front one steerable, mounted in a frame which you straddled. The device
            was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground, thus rolling
            yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
          </p>
        <p>
            The machine became known as the Draisienne (or "hobby horse"). It was
            made entirely of wood. This enjoyed a short lived popularity as a fad,
            not being practical for transportation in any other place than a well
            maintained pathway such as in a park or garden.
